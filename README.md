### SVG Site Update

SVG Site Update is the 6th project of 12 in the TreeHouse Front End Web Development TechDegree.

Graphics are an important part of any website. They add visual appeal and help translate complex ideas into easy to understand imagery. One type of image, SVG (scalable vector graphics) is becoming a widely used graphics format, replacing other types of images on many websites, because of SVGs better performance. This project challenges you to optimize a web page by using common techniques for adding this streamlined image format to web pages.
